The files in this repository are created by following the tutorials provided by the original authors, with or without modifications made by myself.
Naturally, the license of each sub-directory, if un-specified, should be the same as the one specified by the original tutorial.
For example, the license of sub-directory "opencv_tutorials" should be that of "opencv", which is 3-clause BSD License.
